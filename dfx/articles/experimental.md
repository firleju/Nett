# Experimental features

Experimental features are features that are not contained in the
official TOML specification. 

To use the features the `Nett.Exp` package has to be added
as a dependency.

Additionally a experimental feature has to be enabled in TOML
settings used to perform the TOML operations via the
`EnableExperimentalFeatures` method.

You use experimental features at your own risk. At any time 
it is possible that an experimental feature is removed, 
changed completely etc., independent from `Nett's` version.
